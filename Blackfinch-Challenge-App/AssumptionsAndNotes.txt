Assumption #1
That there is user input of the 3 specified values and immediate calculation 
of the possible success followed by outputting the other metrics. This is to 
keep the application simple for this challenge although I realise that a real
world application may offer the total and mean average values as another
UI option.

Assumption #2
That there are services available to provide: total number of applicants,
total value of loans written, mean average LTV. 

Assumption #3
There would be a service to calculate application success which would apply
rules, but in this case I will code that part into the challenge or there
would not be much code apart from calls to services.

Assumption #2
That the amount and secured asset are input in GBP

Note #1
I am going to use as much framework and 3rd party support as is possible to
avoid 'reinventing the wheel' and increasing the opportunity for bugs.

Note #2
The business rules are hard coded here but in real life they would be
implemented (in the service) using some configurable data and/or a rules
engine.

Note #3
I have favoured simpler more terse code for readability rather than 
shorter code

Note #4
I have used command line parameters to keep the 'UI' simple

Note #5
I have just 'mentioned' getting the total number of applicants,
total value of loans written, mean average LTV in the console app
given the 1 hour to spend on this I didn't think it was good use
of time to do more than acknowledge how it might work and where
thr data could get displayed.
